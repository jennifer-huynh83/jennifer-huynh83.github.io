      <h1>Bridging the gap between software development and user experience</h1>

      <h2>Hello, I'm Jennifer Huynh</h2>

      <p>
        I am a senior at the University of Washington Tacoma, graduating in Spring 2025 with a major in Computer Science 
        and Systems and a minor in Innovation and Design. I focus on full-stack development with a strong emphasis on user experience, 
        and I’m passionate about building thoughtful, user-centered technology that makes a real impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve collaborated in fast-paced, cross-functional (multidisciplinary) teams across both web development and user design, 
        and recently joined a startup team that’s driven by user insights in the product development process. I thrive in collaborative 
        environments and love working with tight-knit teams dedicated to solving meaningful problems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can continue growing as a developer while contributing to projects that prioritize 
        accessibility, impact, and innovation.

      <h2>A Little More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in the South Seattle area, where I spent most of my time in school, playing sports, or participating in after-school programs. 
        I later attended the University of Washington in Seattle for a little over a year, where I discovered my interest in web development. 
        Wanting a more close-knit environment to grow in, I transferred to the University of Washington Tacoma to continue pursuing my passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        After transferring, I discovered the User-Centered Design minor. It felt like fate—an opportunity to follow a creative path within tech 
        while also focusing on helping people. The combination of design and technology opened up a meaningful direction for me, and I’ve been 
        exploring it ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a beautiful pet bird named Petey—a green-cheeked conure who loves apples.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then there’s Peni, an adorable cattle husky mix who has a habit of pretending he can’t hear you
