      <h1>Bridging the gap between software development and user experience</h1>

      <h2>Hello, I'm Jennifer Huynh</h2>

      <p>
        I’m Jennifer Huynh, a senior at the University of Washington Tacoma, graduating in Spring 2025 with a major in Computer Science 
        and Systems and a minor in Innovation and Design. I focus on full-stack development with a strong emphasis on user experience, 
        and I’m passionate about building thoughtful, user-centered technology that makes a real impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve collaborated in fast-paced, cross-functional (multidisciplinary) teams across both web development and user design, 
        and recently joined a startup team that’s driven by user insights in the product development process. I thrive in collaborative 
        environments and love working with tight-knit teams dedicated to solving meaningful problems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can continue growing as a developer while contributing to projects that prioritize 
        accessibility, impact, and innovation.
