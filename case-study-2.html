            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                As someone navigating the vast field of computer science, I had often struggled to find 
                a space where creativity met logic—until I discovered UX and web development. My internship 
                at Insights Emerge, a startup focused on turning user insights into thoughtful product design, 
                provided the perfect opportunity to explore this intersection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working alongside a team of interns, a UX supervisor, a developer, and a client, I helped 
                design a Learning Management System (LMS) from the ground up. This case study highlights my 
                role in user research analysis, visual design, prototyping, and early-stage usability 
                planning—all within a real-world, collaborative design environment.
            </p>

        <section id="problem" class="highlight-box">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                How can we design a Learning Management System that truly meets user needs—when the 
                product vision is evolving?
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was unique: I joined the first-ever intern team at Insights Emerge. 
                With no existing structure or documentation in place, we had to build our own workflows, 
                manage team communication, and define our roles as we worked.
            </p>

                Develop a high-fidelity prototype for a Learning Management System informed by user insights, 
                and build a visual brand that reflects the client’s mission.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>As a UX design intern, I contributed across multiple project areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User Research Synthesis: Analyzed user research to identify pain points and translate them into design opportunities</li>
                <li>Brand Development: Co-led branding development, including logo and style guide creation</li>
                <li>UI/UX Design: Designed and prototyped core pages for the LMS using Figma (landing page and navigation structure)</li>
                <li>Collaboration & Communication: Contributed to usability testing planning and participant recruitment</li>
                <li>Created shared team resources and supported collaboration using digital tools</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Process – Research & Team Building</h2>
            <p>
                We began with a team-wide kickoff meeting to meet each other and understand the scope of the project. Our team included interns,
                a UX designer (Tim), a developer, a videographer, and the client.
            </p>
            <p>
                We reviewed past user research and synthesized it on Miro, grouping data into assumptions, pain points, and solutions. While the 
                insights were broad, they provided enough direction for us to begin concept development.
            </p>
            <p>Key Activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attended project and team meetings to align on goals and vision</li>
                <li>Reviewed existing user insights and grouped findings into thematic categories</li>
                <li>Used Miro and Figma to visualize pain points and potential features</li>
                <li>Met with the client to understand tone, vision, and branding direction</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As new interns joined, I helped create a shared Google Doc to record meeting notes and decisions. This became a vital tool for 
                keeping everyone aligned, especially with rotating schedules and flexible meeting times
            </p>

        <section id="process-design" class="visual-block">
            <h2>Process – Visual Design & Prototyping</h2>
            <p>
                With a stronger foundation in place, we began to build the visual language for the LMS. I explored color theory, brand expression, 
                and UI design standards for educational platforms.
            </p>
            <p>Key Activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Created style guide proposals using Coolors and Figma</li>
                <li>Co-designed logo concepts to reflect client themes</li>
                <li>Researched LMS platforms for UI best practices and patterns</li>
                <li>Prototyped a landing page and key linked pages in Figma</li>
                <li>Incorporated prior research findings into UI decisions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                While designing the landing page, I realized we lacked user-specific insights for some elements. During a 1:1 meeting, my supervisor 
                reminded me of the client’s earlier sketches—an underused reference that helped guide my design. I revised the prototype based on this, 
                aligning my visuals more closely with the client’s expectations while keeping the user journey smooth and goal-oriented.

            <h2>Process – Brainstorming & Usability Testing Prep</h2>
            <p>In the second half of the internship, our focus shifted to collaboration and testing.</p>
            <p>
                We ran a rapid design sprint with the full intern group, using whiteboard sketches and idea clustering to align on the LMS’s core structure. 
                These sketches later became the blueprint for our prototype’s navigation model.
            </p>
            <p>Key Activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ran collaborative ideation and sketching sessions</li>
                <li>Translated group concepts into digital wireframes</li>
                <li>Began preparing for usability testing:</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Drafted scenarios</li>
                <li>Started recruiting participants</li>
                <li>Planned testing structure with guidance from our supervisor</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I was especially excited to take the lead in participant recruitment and test script creation. We reviewed resources from our supervisor and 
                began forming a plan for moderated testing that could simulate real user flows.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                This internship was more than a project—it was a lesson in flexibility, communication, and self-direction. With no clear roadmap, 
                I had to help build structure while contributing to the product itself. At times, this ambiguity was overwhelming, but it also gave 
                me room to take initiative and grow as a designer.
            </p>
            <p>I learned how to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborate effectively across disciplines</li>
                <li>Translate research into meaningful design decisions</li>
                <li>Iterate quickly based on feedback and constraints</li>
                <li>Stay organized with tools like Trello, Google Docs, and Slack</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Working with real stakeholders taught me the value of aligning early and often. It also highlighted the difference between 
                classroom projects and real-world design—this work required balancing vision with feasibility, and learning to design with 
                others, not just for them.
