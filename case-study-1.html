      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In the heart of Pierce County, surrounded by evergreens and mountain views, a growing threat lingers 
        every summer—wildfires. As these disasters grow more frequent, the Pierce Conservation District (PCD) 
        needed a stronger way to help residents prepare.

    <section id="problem" class="highlight-box">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        PCD’s existing wildfire preparedness webpage was outdated in both design and content, offering limited 
        information and lacking clear, actionable resources for residents. Critical information—such as information 
        about services, wildfire preparedness events, and other resources for individual action—was either missing 
        or not apparent, reducing the site’s effectiveness in helping the community prepare for wildfire threats.

        <div>
          <p>
            As part of a community-focused UX design course at the University of Washington Tacoma, I took on this project 
            solo, from research through iteration. I collaborated with PCD staff and community partners to ensure the final 
            design would genuinely serve the people most affected by wildfire threats. My responsibilities included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Partnered with PCD staff to define the problem</li>
            <li>Conducted research</li>
            <li>Built and tested prototypes within the CMS</li>
            <li>Ran usability tests</li>
            <li>Iterated based on feedback</li>
            <li>Presented the final design</li>

      <h2>Process – Research & Discovery</h2>
      <p>
        The research started with a question: How do rural homeowners in Pierce County find and use wildfire preparedness 
        resources? In the research process, I:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Conducted secondary research on demographics and wildfire impacts. The U.S. Census was used to discover the age range 
          and primary language spoken in Pierce County, and the focus areas of the wildfire preparedness resources. Information 
          was gathered from the Washington State Department of Natural Resources on the impacts of wildfires in Washington State.
        </li>
        <li>Interviewed PCD staff to identify content needs. Two PCD staff members were interviewed, </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            One being the Wildfire Prevention Program Manager, identifying the needs of the redesign. These needs included the 
            inclusion of key services, videos, and other resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another is the Executive Director of PCD, identifying the need for resources in other languages, specifically for the 
            growing Slavic community.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Conducted a comparative analysis of other county/state wildfire websites. This produced the ideas of including resources on:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Information about individual action</li>
          <li>Infographics for more visual learners</li>
          <li>Videos on preparing for wildfires</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Learned more about web accessibility from the U.S. Department of Justice. This research highlighted several important factors to consider, including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Sufficient color contrast</li>
          <li>Alternative text for images</li>
          <li>Captions for videos</li>
          <li>Support for keyboard navigation</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Primary user research. Due to the limited time frame of this course and other factors, no primary user research was conducted. 
          This is not a “typical” route to go, but with the constraints of this project. The prototype was built using secondary research.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Process – Sketching & Ideation</h2>
      <p>
        The website uses a restrictive content management system (CMS) where the type of content you can include (text, video, images, etc.) is in widget 
        form, and you drag these widgets into the page to create the page. Due to this form of CMS, there is a constraint on what and how content can be 
        created. Another constraint is that this redesign is of a specific webpage within a larger website, with this, it means that the redesign also has 
        to follow a similar structure and layout of the website in its entirety. I sketched the redesign within real-world constraints, preserving the 
        existing structure while improving clarity and flow.

    <section id="process-prototype" class="visual-block">
      <h2>Process – Prototyping</h2>
      <p>
        Rather than designing in Figma, I built the high-fidelity prototype directly within the website’s CMS, ensuring it could be realistically implemented. 
        This approach made it easier to test what was possible within the constraints of the actual platform. The CMS allows the creation of drafts of the 
        webpage that are not live. I created a draft to begin my prototyping, which mitigates the risks of redesigning live.

      <h2>Process – Usability Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Testing was conducted using a survey-based format due to limitations in reaching rural users. Similar to how a typical usability test would go, 
        the survey included three main sections:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Demographics: Ensuring each participant matched the target audience criteria.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Where in Pierce County do you live?</li>
          <li>Are you a homeowner?</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Tasks: Participants were asked to complete six tasks to locate specific information and rate the task’s difficulty.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Locate the section...</li>
          <li>In which section of the webpage did you find this information?</li>
          <li>How easy or difficult was it to find this section? 1 = very easy, 5 = very difficult</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Reflection: Evaluating clarity, missing information, and layout.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>What was your understanding of the purpose of the webpage?</li>
          <li>Was any part of the webpage's text or explanations unclear or confusing?</li>
          <li>Was there any additional information you felt was missing from the webpage?</li>
          <li>Was there any functionality or layout feature you felt was missing or could be improved on the webpage?</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Participants included:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Residents of the focus area: Pierce County Fire District #23, East Pierce Fire & Rescue, Key Peninsula Fire Department, 
              & Mt. Rainier Lions Club were contacted.
          </li>
          <ul>
              <li>
                  The Pierce County Fire District #23 fire department consists of many local volunteers. These volunteers themselves 
                  live within Ashford and Elbe.
              </li>
              <li>
                  The East Pierce Fire & Rescue and Key Peninsula Fire Department hold a stake as members of the community and can 
                  provide insight into what is important in terms of fire safety.
              </li>
              <li>
                  The Mt. Rainier Lions Club is a network of community members who get together to tackle challenges in the community.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>
              General Pierce County residents: Additional residents participated to supplement findings. These participants 
              lived outside the target areas.
          </li>
          <li>
              Large Language Models: Due to limited participant availability, AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) were used to 
              simulate feedback from a middle-aged homeowner in Eatonville. The Large Language Models were asked to answer the same survey 
              questions as if they were middle-aged homeowners in Eatonville.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>Key Feedback:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The overall usability was rated positively, most tasks were rated towards “easy”, with a few towards “difficult”, mostly due to confusion about the tasks.</li>
          <li>Improved navigation – A navigation bar would help users identify what is on the webpage at a glance.</li>
          <ul>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
          Due to course constraints, limited access to target users, and restrictions within the CMS, the design process 
          deviated from traditional methods. Challenges included the inability to conduct user research before prototyping, 
          the unconventional use of large language models in usability testing, reliance on survey-based feedback, and the 
          inability to implement certain features suggested by users. These limitations were not overlooked. User research 
          and robust usability testing with real participants are essential to centering design around user needs. Despite 
          these constraints, the final design was created thoughtfully, with care and intention, using the best possible 
          approaches available under the circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
          While the process had its challenges, the deeper purpose of this project provided constant motivation. This project 
          wasn’t just about creating an interface—it was about supporting wildfire preparedness and protecting the people and 
          environments I care about. By merging my passion for UX with my connection to nature and community resilience, I 
          aimed to design a tool grounded in empathy, accessibility, and real-world relevance. This personal investment helped 
          ensure that, even with limitations, the design stayed rooted in values that matter: clarity, equity, and impact.
